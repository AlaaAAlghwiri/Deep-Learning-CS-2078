# Written Responses (Part 1)

Given that $f_*(x) = 6x + 4\cos(3x + 2) - x^2 + 10\ln(\frac{|x|}{10} + 1) + 7$, find the following:

## Problem 1

In this part, I will need to find $\phi(x) = [?]^T$: Based on the given function and in order,

$$\phi(x) = \begin{bmatrix}x & cos(3x + 2) & x^2 & \ln(\frac{|x|}{10} + 1) & 1\end{bmatrix}^T$$

## Problem 2

In this part i will need to find the optimal weights that corresponds to the features in part 1:

$$w^* = \begin{bmatrix}6 & 4 & -1 & 10 & 7\end{bmatrix}^T$$

## Problem 3

In this part, i will need to evaluate the same requirements for part 1 and 2 but for the following function:

$$f_*(x) = 6x \times 4\cos(3x + 2) \times x^2 \times 10\ln(\frac{|x|}{10} + 1) \times 7$$

In this case, I can simplify the multiplication terms as follow: $6 \times 4 \times 7 \times 10 = 1680$, then we get the following:

$$1680 \times x^3 \times \cos(3x + 2) \times\ln(\frac{|x|}{10} + 1)$$

$$\phi(x) = \begin{bmatrix} x^3 \times \cos(3x + 2) \times\ln(\frac{|x|}{10} + 1) \end{bmatrix}$$ $$w^* = \begin{bmatrix}1689\end{bmatrix}^T$$\
\

## Problem 4

In this problem, we are looking for:

$\frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{y}} g(\hat{y}, y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{y}} \left( \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 \right)$

Since differentiation is linear, we can move the derivative inside the summation:

$\frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{y}_i} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2$

$\frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{y}_i} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 = 2 (\hat{y}_i - y_i)$

$\frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} 2 (\hat{y}_i - y_i)$

And finally, the derivative evaluates to:

$\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)$

And this is obviously: $\mathbb{E}[\hat{y} - y]$

In a vector form:

$$
\frac{1}{m} \begin{bmatrix} \hat{y_1}-y_1 & \hat{y_2}-y_2 & ... & \hat{y_m}-y_m \end{bmatrix}^T
$$

## Problem 5

$\hat{y} = f(X, w) = Xw$

Now, i need to find:

$\frac{\partial}{\partial w} f(X, w)$ = $\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\sum_{i=1}^{m} X_{i} w_i$

Solution:

$= \frac{\partial}{\partial w}\sum_{i=1}^{m} X_i w_i$

$= \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial w}X_i w_i$

And finally:

$\frac{\partial \hat{y}_i}{\partial w_i} = \sum_{i=1}^{m}X_i$

In a matrix representation:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
X_1 & X_2 & X_3 & .... & X_m
\end{bmatrix}$$

## Problem 6

In this question, i will evaluate the gradient for the loss function with respect to the weight $w$. And this should be expressed in matrices/vectors without summation.

$\nabla l(w)$ = $\frac{\partial}{\partial{w}} g(f(X,w), y)$

$\frac{\partial}{\partial{w}} g(f(X,w), y)$ = $\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{w}} \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}(X_iw_i - y_i)^2$

= $\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}(X_iw_i - y_i)x_i$

Using matrix representation:

$$\nabla l(w) = X^T(Xw - y)$$
