## Question (1) Math Review (25 points)

### Question (1_1): $f(x,y,z) = 3x^2 + sin(y)z$, I need to find partial derivatives for each x,y, and z:

Solution:

With respect to x: $\frac{\partial{f(x,y,z)}}{\partial{x}}$ = $6x$, everything else is constant as they don't have x in their representation.

With respect to y: $\frac{\partial{f(x,y,z)}}{\partial{y}}$ = $z\cos(y)$, the first term derivative is zero in this case.

With respect to z: $\frac{\partial{f(x,y,z)}}{\partial{z}}$ = $\sin(y)$, the first term derivative is also zero in this case.

### Question (1_2): In this question, I will need to find the $\nabla f(x,y,z)$:

Using the results from the previous question, $\nabla f(x,y,z)$ = \[$6x$, $z\cos(y)$, $\sin(y)$\]

### Question (1_3): Here we are replicating 1 and 2 but $f(x) = 3x_1^2 + \sin(x_2)x3$:

$\nabla f(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ = \[$6x_1$, $x_3\cos(x_2)$, $\sin(x_2)$\]

### Question (1_4_A):In this part, I will need to get the derivative for $||x||_2^2$:

$||x||_2^2$ = $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i^2$ = $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2$

In this case: $\frac{\partial{||x||_2^2}}{\partial{x}}$ = $\frac{\partial{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2}}{\partial{x_1}}$ + $\frac{\partial{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2}}{\partial{x_2}}$ + ... + $\frac{\partial{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2}}{\partial{x_n}}$ =\
= \[ $2x_1$, $2x_2$, $...$, $2x_n$\], This represents the partial derivative for each x.

### Question (1_4_B):In this part, I will need to get the derivative for $||x||_2$:

$||x||_2$ = $\sqrt(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i^2)$ = $\sqrt (x_1^2) + \sqrt(x_2^2) + ... + \sqrt(x_n^2)$

To get this derivative, $\frac{\partial{||x||_2}}{\partial{x}}$, I will be using the chain rule assuming that a new function h(z) = $\sqrt z$, where z(x) = $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i^2$.

$\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{x}}$ = $\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{z}}$ \* $\frac{\partial{z(x)}}{\partial{x}}$

$\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{x}}$ = $\frac{1}{2\sqrt(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i^2)}$ \* $\sum_{i=1}^{n}2x_i$ $\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{x}}$ = $\frac{x}{||x||_2}$

### Question (1_4_C):In this part, I will need to get the derivative for $\|x\|_1$:

$\|x\|_1$ = $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}|x_i|$ = $|x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_n|$

$\frac{\partial{\|x\|_1}}{\partial{x}}$: depends on the value of $X_i$. If positive, it would be 1, if negative, it would be -1, and undefined when x equals zero. To represent the derivative of this function, the sign function can be used in this case:

$\frac{\partial{\|x\|_1}}{\partial{x}}$ = $[sign(x_1), sign(x_2),...,sign(x_n)]^T$

### Question (1_4_D):In this part, I will need to get the derivative for $\|x\|\infty$:

$\|x\|\infty$ = $max|X_i|$, This entails many cases under the hood and can be represented using the sign function:

$\frac{\partial{\|x\|\infty}}{\partial{x_i}}$ = $sign(x_i)$ Accordingly, $\frac{\partial{\|x\|\infty}}{\partial{x_i}}$ = $[0,..., sign(x_i),...,0]^T$. Those components that are not achieving the maximum, the derivative is 0.

### Question (1_5): In this part, I will need to get the derivative of f(x) =$e^{\frac{-1}{2}\|x_i\|_2^2}$.

For this function, the chain rule will be used assuming a new function h(z) = $e^{z}$, where z = ${\frac{-1}{2}\|x_i\|_2^2}$. In this case, we would be looking for:

$\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{x}}$ = $\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{z}}$ \* $\frac{\partial{z(x)}}{x}$

$\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{x}}$ = $e^{z}$ \* $-x_i$

$\frac{\partial{h(z)}}{\partial{x}}$ = $-x_i$ \*$e^{\frac{-1}{2}\|x_i\|_2^2}$ = \[$-x_1e^{\frac{-1}{2}\|x_1\|_2^2}$, $-x_2e^{\frac{-1}{2}\|x_2\|_2^2}$,..., $-x_ne^{\frac{-1}{2}\|x_n\|_2^2}$ \]
